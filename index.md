## Currently

I'm a Software Developer, from Belgium, working on various projects actively on GitHub.
Living in Belgium again since 2018, while working as a Principal Software Engineer for ThreeFold Technology,
a company which ambition it is to change the way internet as well as the banking system operates.
The company is based in Ghent (Belgium) but has offices and partners all over the world.
Here I work mostly in Go, python and lately Rust as well on blockchain-, cloud- and automation technology.
